NAME
    Prompt::Timeout - prompt() with auto-selecting default value in case of
    inactivity

SYNOPSIS
     use Prompt::Timeout;
     my $res = prompt ( $question, $default, $timeout );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides only one function, prompt(), and it's exported by
    default.

  prompt
     my $res = prompt ( $question, $default, $timeout );

    Prints a $question and waits for the input. If no keys are pressed
    during $timeout seconds, $default is assumed. When pressing just Enter
    key, $default is assumed. If prompt() detects that it is not running
    interactively, $default will be used without prompting too.

    If you want to disable inactivity timer if any key is pressed during
    prompt(), you can invoke it with another optional parameter:

     my $res = prompt ( $question, $default, $timeout, 1 );

    Once a key is pressed, inactivity timer is disabled.

    When $timeout vales is omitted, it assumes 60 seconds.
